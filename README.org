  Scripts to help me administer Solaris 10.

  This scripts are a bit bias'd towards how I do things, and you may
  need to modify them accordingly.

  For instance, I use virtual NICs with crossbow for networking my
  zones.

  Also, I map my home directory into each zone.  

  Search for and alter the variables in the config section near the
  front, and the contents of the zone_tmplt_str variable to change these
  things.  

  Also, please make suggestions.
